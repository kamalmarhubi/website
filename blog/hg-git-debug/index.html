<p>I’ve been delinquent in this series, sorry about that! Again, flying got the best of me: I was busy during the day on Friday, and then flew overnight. Saturday was recovery, and now it’s Sunday. I’m not flying again before Christmas, so here’s hoping I can keep up the daily habit for the rest of the series!</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://kamalmarhubi.com/blog/hg-extensions/">second post</a>, I lamented my inability to use hg-git. <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/utiigb/hg_advent_m_02_extensions#c_2hfhfi">Over on lobsters</a>, Jordi—a fellow Montrealer—said the bug I was seeing was confusing to the assembled minds of #mercurial, and that the clone should have worked. This was encouraging, but I haven’t had time to get back to this until today. But now I think I’ve figured out the root cause!</p>
<h2 id="phases-and-filtered-repos">phases and filtered repos</h2>
<p>In the <a href="http://kamalmarhubi.com/blog/hg-advent/#phases">first post</a>, I called out <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/Phases">phases</a> as one of the features that got me interested in mercurial. I excitedly included the following in my <code>.hgrc</code> before ever running mercurial:</p>
<pre><code>[phases]
new-commit = secret</code></pre>
<p>Pretty self-explanatory: it tells mercurial to put new commits in the secret phase. This prevents accidental pushing of work in progress: you’d have to explicitly push a revision that is secret for it to get sent out.</p>
<p>This next bit is going to be a bit hand-wavy, as I didn’t spend much time looking at the mercurial internals. But my skimming leads me to believe that there’s a way to get different views of a repo, eg including or excluding secret or closed or obsolete changesets. Looking up a changeset that’s filtered out in the view raises an error whose error is exactly one of the ones I was seeing:</p>
<pre><code>except (error.FilteredIndexError, error.FilteredLookupError):
    raise error.FilteredRepoLookupError(_(&quot;filtered revision &#39;%s&#39;&quot;)
                                        % pycompat.bytestr(changeid))</code></pre>

<h2 id="how-hg-git-clones-a-git-repo">how hg-git clones a git repo</h2>
<p>With hg-git: running <code>hg clone</code> against a git repo does two things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>clone the git repo as a git repo and store it under the .hg directory</li>
<li>import all the git commits as mercurial changesets, storing some metadata to allow back-and-forth translation</li>
</ol>
<p>Roughly, the second step runs through all the git commits from the roots upwards, and imports them one by one. To make this easier, let’s just think about a completely linear history. Going root commit upwards means each commit being imported should have had all its parents imported first. That’s important since the imported mercurial changeset for a git commit needs to refer to the imported changeset for the parent git commit.</p>
<p>While doing the import, hg-git maintains a couple of maps: one from git commit sha1s to hg changeset ids, and another that is the inverse.</p>
<h2 id="where-it-all-goes-wrong">where it all goes wrong</h2>
<p>Because I had set <code>phases.new-commit</code> to <code>secret</code>, the changesets hg-git creates are all in the secret phase. But from what I can tell, the mercurial repo object that hg-git uses filters out secret commits.</p>
<p>So here’s what happens:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>hg-git imports the root commit with sha1 <code>ababab</code> as a root changeset with id <code>121212</code> whose phase is secret</li>
<li>hg-git goes to import that next commit whose sha1 is <code>cdcdcd</code>, and for this it needs the mercurial changeset id of the parent, <code>ababab</code></li>
<li>hg-git looks up the <code>ababab</code> in the git-sha1-to-hg-commit-id map, and finds <code>121212</code></li>
<li>hg-git then looks up this changeset id in the mercurial repo object</li>
<li>the repo is filtering this revision out since its secret, so it results in that <code>FilteredRepoLookupErrro</code></li>
<li>boom</li>
</ol>
<p>Now hg-git has a couple of options related to phases: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/durin42/hg-git#markdown-header-hggitusephases"><code>hggit.usephases</code></a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/durin42/hg-git#markdown-header-gitpublic"><code>git.public</code></a>, but these affect other aspects of the import. Neither of them change either the phase of new commits, or the filter on the repo object.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">what’s next</h2>
<p>I’ve <a href="https://bitbucket.org/durin42/hg-git/issues/266/hg-git-interacts-poorly-with-phasesnew">filed an issue</a> against hg-git to figure out what the right fix is, and will hopefully submit a patch once that’s figured out.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, I’ve just temporarily set <code>phases.new-commit</code> to <code>public</code> when doing the <code>hg clone</code> and can actually clone git repos. This means I can much more easily use mercurial day-to-day, so this series should hopefully get more grounded in real use.</p>
