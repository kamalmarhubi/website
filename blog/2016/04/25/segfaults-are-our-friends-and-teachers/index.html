  <article class="post-content">
    <p>This afternoon, I got a segmentation fault in a Rust program, and was confused. This is Rust, I shouldn’t get segfaults! I quickly checked the couple of places I used <code>unsafe</code>, and they were either calling C functions (and checking the errors), or telling the compiler not to initialize some memory because I was going to write into it unconditionally before reading from it.</p>

<p>So, everything should be fine, right?</p>

<p>Evidently not:</p>

<pre><code>$ cargo build --quiet
$ target/debug/kern-value 1
Segmentation fault
</code></pre>

<h2 id="ok-but-what-is-a-segfault">ok, but what is a segfault?</h2>

<p>If you’ve written some C, you’ve almost certainly seen a segmentation fault at some point. I spent a long time thinking of it as a ‘thing that happens when you use pointers wrong in C’. That’s mostly true, but a segmentation fault actually has a very specific meaning. You get one when a process tries to access memory in a way that it’s not allowed to, or accessing invalid memory.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of a really simple program that will segfault:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat segfault.c
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void) {
    char *uninitialized;
    printf("%c", *uninitialized);

    return 0;
}
$ gcc segfault.c
$ ./a.out
Segmentation fault
</code></pre>

<p>This program segfaults because the entire stack is set to <code>0</code> at program start. This includes the <code>uninitialized</code> pointer, which will be a null pointer, pointing to <code>0x0</code>. When the program tries to print the value it points to, it attempts to read from the null address. That address is invalid, and that’s why we get a segmentation fault.</p>

<p>Segmentation faults are raised by the memory management unit (MMU), which is a piece of hardware! Sections of memory can have different access permissions on them: read, write, and execute. Operating systems use this to isolate processes, and to protect kernel memory from being written to by user code.</p>

<p>If a process tries to write to read-only memory, say, or execute non-executable memory, then the MMU hardware tells the kernel there was a segmentation fault. The kernel delivers the news to the process as a signal: <code>SIGSEGV</code>. By default, that terminates the process.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-got-the-segfault">how we got the segfault</h2>

<p>Some context: I’m playing around with reading and writing to pipes with large buffers. I’d previously been setting the pipe size to 1 MB, which is the maximum an unprivileged process can set it to on my machine:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat /proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-size
1048576
</code></pre>

<p>My code had a constant <code>PIPE_SIZE</code> for the size of the pipe. I was <em>also</em> using it as the size of a stack-allocated buffer. For my experiments, I’d just changed that constant from 1 MB to 16 MB to test bigger pipes when running as root.</p>

<p>Realising this this set off something in the back of my mind: I vaguely remembered that stacks on Linux default to 8MB. Could the segfault be from going past the stack limit?</p>

<p>I switched to C to verify it:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat -n test-stack.c
     1  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
     2
     3  #define BUF_SIZE (16*1024*1024)
     4
     5  int main(void) {
     6      char buf[BUF_SIZE];
     7      printf("%lu\n", sizeof(buf));
     8
     9      return 0;
    10  }
$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror test-stack.c
$ ./a.out
Segmentation fault
</code></pre>

<p>Aha! A pretty minimal C program that has the same result. This program allocates a 16 MB array on the stack, and then prints its size. Except it segfaults instead. With the <code>BUF_SIZE</code> set to 8 KB less than 8 MB, everything works. With it set to 8 MB, it segfaults.<sup id="fnref:why-8-mb"><a href="#fn:why-8-mb" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Hypothesis confirmed!<sup id="fnref:why-rust-ok"><a href="#fn:why-rust-ok" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="seeing-which-instruction-failed">seeing which instruction failed</h2>

<p>I wanted to get an idea of exactly <em>when</em> the segfault happened, so I ran it under gdb:</p>

<pre><code>$ gcc -g -Wall -Wextra -Werror test-stack.c
$ gdb -silent a.out
Reading symbols from a.out...done.
(gdb) run
Starting program: /tmp/a.out

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

(gdb) backtrace

   0x000000000040052b &lt;+37&gt;:    retq
End of assembler dump.
</code></pre>

<p>So the failure was on the call to <code>printf</code>. <code>0x1000000</code> is 16 MB, the size of the buffer. The <code>sub    $0x1000000,%rsp</code> instruction is modifying the stack pointer register <code>%rsp</code> to make space for the buffer. When we get to the <code>callq</code> instruction, things exploded!</p>

<p>The <code>callq</code> instruction on x86 first pushes the return address onto the stack, then jumps to the called function. The return address is the current value instruction pointer register <code>%ip</code>, and is where the <code>ret</code> instruction in <code>printf</code> will jump back to. The segfault happens at this point: the CPU attempts to store the return address somewhere outside of the region of memory that’s set aside for the stack, and boom!</p>

<h2 id="luck-and-guard-pages">luck and guard pages</h2>

<p>I think we’re actually kind of lucky to get a segfault. It’s quite possible the bit of memory that’s a few megabytes past our stack <em>was</em> writeable by our process. We’d then go happily corrupting whatever memory was there and probably all kinds of bad things would happen. Segmentation faults are actually our friends!</p>

<p>Modern compilers have stack protection features that help detect overflows. I’m <em>very</em> hazy on the details, but I think they include setting some pages of memory just after the stack to be read only. These are called guard pages. Attempts to write there would result in a segmentation fault. This helps catch stack overflow attempts that involve marching off the end of the stack. However, writing 8 MB after the end of the stack is beyond the guard pages, so we <em>could</em> have ended up in writeable memory.</p>

<h2 id="setting-stack-size-limits-in-the-shell-ulimit">setting stack size limits in the shell: ulimit</h2>

<p>I took this as an opportunity to Learn. I wanted to make this program run without changing its source. At first I thought I could set the stack size with compiler options, but some searching revealed this wasn’t true on Linux. It turns out you can set it with the <code>ulimit</code> shell built-in<sup id="fnref:why-builtin"><a href="#fn:why-builtin" class="footnote">3</a></sup>:</p>

<pre><code>$ ulimit --soft --stack-size 32768
$ ./a.out
16777216
</code></pre>

<p>Success, and without changing the source <em>or</em> the binary! The <code>--stack-size</code> flag says we’re setting the stack size to 32768 KB or 32 MB. The <code>--soft</code> flag says to set the soft limit. I’ll just paste from my <code>man ulimit</code> on my system to explain the difference between hard and soft limits—the <code>-S</code> flag is short for <code>--soft</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A hard limit can only be decreased. Once it is set it cannot be increased; a soft limit may be increased up to the value of the hard limit. If neither <code>-H</code> nor <code>-S</code> is specified, both the soft and hard limits are updated when assigning a new limit value, and the soft limit is used when reporting the current value.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="setting-stack-size-limits-from-inside-your-program-setrlimit2">setting stack size limits from inside your program: setrlimit(2)</h2>

<p>If you use a lot of stack, it’s not great to force the user to run <code>ulimit</code> before running your program. Instead, you can set it yourself using the <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/setrlimit.html"><code>setrlimit(2)</code></a> system call. Here’s proof it works:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat -n test-stack.c
     1  #include &lt;errno.h&gt;
     2  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
     3  #include &lt;sys/resource.h&gt;
     4
     5  #define BUF_SIZE (16*1024*1024)
     6
     7  void run(void) {
     8      char buf[BUF_SIZE];
     9      printf("%lu\n", sizeof(buf));
    10  }
    11
    12  int main(void) {
    13      struct rlimit stack_limit = {
    14          .rlim_cur = 2 * BUF_SIZE,
    15          .rlim_max = RLIM_INFINITY,
    16      };
    17
    18      if (setrlimit(RLIMIT_STACK, &amp;stack_limit)) {
    19          perror("setrlimit failed");
    20          return 1;
    21      }
    22
    23      run();
    24
    25      return 0;
    26  }
$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror test-stack.c
$ ulimit -Ss 8192
$ ./a.out
16777216
</code></pre>

<p>A fun note: we had to put the buffer in a separate function. Otherwise the stack pointer would be adjusted before the call to <code>setrlimit</code>, and then <em>that</em> call would result in a segfault! This way the stack adjustment happens after calling <code>setrlimit</code>, and everything works out.</p>

<p>Allocating lots of stack space in main isn’t a great idea anyway, since you limit what’s available for the rest of your program. A static buffer would probably be better for this program; for others a heap buffer would work better.</p>

<h2 id="diving-into-the-depths-for-fun-and-learning">diving into the depths for fun and learning</h2>

<p>I had a fun hour or two investigating this. It’s not always possible to take the time in the moment, but it’s really rewarding when you can. I only vaguely knew about the <code>ulimit</code> command, and didn’t know anything at all about <code>setrlimit(2)</code>. Since I’ve been programming in languages that output native code a bunch lately, I’ve also wanted to learn more about object file formats, linkers, in-process memory layout, and more. Learning a bit more about stack guard pages is a great step in that direction!</p>

      <p>Curiously, I found that if I had a buffer size of even 1 byte over (8 MB - 8 KB), I still got the segfault. I’m not yet sure what’s going on there! <a href="#fnref:why-8-mb" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:why-rust-ok">

      <p>Rust really likes to tout its memory safety. This seems like it should mean no segmentation faults, which is why I was confused at getting one. There’s <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/reference.html#behavior-considered-undefined">a very specific set of behaviors</a> that aren’t allowed in Rust programs. The Rust program got a segmentation fault because it attempted to write to inaccessible memory, but only through the stack pointer. None of the undefined behaviors disallow this, which I think is why it’s ok for this Rust program to segfault. <a href="#fnref:why-rust-ok" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:why-builtin">

      <p><code>ulimit</code> must be a shell built-in and not an executable file because it sets a property of the shell’s process. Other fun examples include setting the working directory (<code>cd</code>), and setting environment variables (<code>set -x</code> in bash). These were some fun things I found out when <a href="https://github.com/kamalmarhubi/shell-workshop">building a shell</a>, which is a totally worthwhile and fun exercise! <a href="#fnref:why-builtin" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
