  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I’ve been neglecting the updates, but here we go! Since the last update, I got
a prototype out, but it was something that wasn’t on my list… I need to
figure out if it counts as one of the 10 or not :-)</p>

<h1 id="rust-bisect">rust-bisect</h1>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kamalmarhubi/rust-bisect">rust-bisect</a> is a little tool to help track down changes in Rust nightlies. It
works a lot like <code>git bisect run</code>. You give it a command, a nightly build where
it succeeds, and a nightly build where it fails, and it does binary search to
find the first nightly where it fails.</p>

<h1 id="cargo-fmt-diff">cargo fmt-diff</h1>

<p>I’ve decided to give a name to the project formerly described as ‘rustfmt line
range &amp; diff reading (format a patch)’: <code>cargo fmt-diff</code>. It’ll be a command
you can run to format the lines you’ve changed. Ideally, you’ll be able to put
it in a VCS commit hook, and never introduce bad formatting. Think of it as a
style-oriented analogue of not rocket science:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The Not Rocket Science Rule Of Software Engineering:</strong></p>

  <p>automatically maintain a repository of code that always passes all the tests</p>
</blockquote>

<p>―<a href="http://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/1597.html">Graydon Hoare</a></p>

<p>A (very!) rough plan of how I intend to get this done:</p>

<ol>
  <li>add command line flag that takes a set of line ranges to format (progress:
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt/issues/844">rustfmt PR #844, ‘rustfmt: Add an ineffectual –file-lines flag behind a
feature’</a>)</li>
  <li>parse a unified diff to get sets of line ranges to pass to the above flag</li>
</ol>

<p>If you’re especially interested in this feature, the rustfmt issue to track is
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt/issues/434">#434</a>.</p>

<h1 id="containy-thing-name-tbc">containy-thing (name TBC)</h1>

<p>I’m promoting a project I was working on over the holidays onto my list of 10:
containy-thing. It was formerly described as ‘container thing for running
commands in container context without privileges’, and I mentioned it in <a href="http://kamalmarhubi.com/blog/2016/01/26/eat-your-greens-and-read-your-man-pages/">Eat
your greens and read your man pages</a> a month ago. The goal is to
allow running commands in a container environment without root privileges. I
just pushed up <a href="https://github.com/kamalmarhubi/containy-thing">a basic repository</a> for it.</p>

<h1 id="rust-and-the-update-framework">Rust and The Update Framework</h1>

<p>I’m also promoting a fairly ambitious project onto the list of ten. In the list
of 100, it was cryptically described as ‘tuf + rust + crates’. The goal of this
project is to secure the Rust crate ecosystem using <a href="http://theupdateframework.com/">The Update Framework</a>
(TUF). I’ve been interested in this project since well before I wrote any Rust.
Verifiable provenance of software artifacts is extremely important, and Rust
absolutely should have a good approach to it.</p>

<p>The Update Framework is a really well-designed and well-thought out approach to
securing software updates and distribution. It’s being implemented for Python,
Docker, and other ecosystems. While I was in New York attending the Recurse
Center, I met up with the researchers behind TUF (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/75#issuecomment-179904144">minutes</a>) to talk about
implementing it for Rust, but I hadn’t followed up until recently. The issue to
watch for this one is <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/75">#75</a> on the Crates.io repository.</p>

<p>This project is really exciting, and more than a little bit scary because of
how important it is to get right. But I won’t be working on it alone, so that’s
great! The first steps are to refamiliarize myself with TUF, and then put
together a Rust RFC. The TUF folks have recently had <a href="https://isis.poly.edu/~jcappos/papers/kuppusamy_nsdi_16.pdf">a paper
accepted</a> that describes how they have improved TUF even further,
and I’m starting with reading that.</p>

<h1 id="summary-of-the-list-of-ten">Summary of the list-of-ten:</h1>

<p>My list of ten now contains four projects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cargo fmt-diff</li>
  <li>containy-thing</li>
  <li>silly memcached or redis-speaking key value store whose nature of silliness
is as yet undisclosed</li>
  <li>TUF and Crates.io</li>
</ul>
