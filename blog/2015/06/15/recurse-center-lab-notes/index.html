  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Today I joined the ‘shipping’ checking group, instigated by <a href="http://natwelch.com/">Nat Welch</a>.
The idea is to work towards actually shipping something, which I really want to
get better at while at RC.</p>

<p>I decided on a simple utility to list IP addresses. This came out of my writing
on <a href="/blog/2015/06/11/ifconfig-how-does-it-even/">how <code>ifconfig</code> works</a>. <a href="http://plover.com/~mjd/">Mark Dominus</a> said a
utility that just listed IP addresses would be handy, and he’s never come
across one. I did a little poking around the googles and stackoverflows, and
most answers involved <code>ifconfig</code>, <code>grep</code>, and either <code>sed</code> or <code>awk</code>. A few
listed the Linux only <code>ip addr show</code> which still has a lot of cruft in its
output. I also came across another Linux only option, <code>hostname
--all-ip-addresses</code>, which prints them one per line, ignoring loopback and link
local addresses.</p>

<p>The last one is pretty close to what I would like, but it’s missing some handy
flags to specify IPv4 or IPv6, which interface, or whether to include link
local or loopback addresses. It’s also Linux only, which a standalone utility
could work around. I’m aiming to have a fairly polished first version for Linux
systems this week, possibly even dabbling in Debian packaging.</p>

<p>Of course, right after deciding that, I got distracted following up on some
links <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/">Anil Madhavapeddy</a> gave me last Thursday while he was at RC. It
turns out the IPC performance is of a lot of interest to virtualization people,
and he had this <a href="https://github.com/avsm/ipc-bench">big set of benchmarks</a>. I also read through slides
from his FOSDEM 2012 talk entitled <em>The Wild West of UNIX I/O</em>. This goes into
a lot of details around non-uniform memory architecture (NUMA) and how it
affects latency and throughput between core in a many core machine. It’s
incredibly fascinating that the interconnections between the cores can be
inferred from measuring IPC performance.</p>

<p>Even more interesting to me was the little bit at the end on Fable I/O, an
‘ongoing attempt at a “new” sockets API for high-performance data’. Sadly, the
‘ongoing’ part of this no longer seems valid: the best I could find was a
<a href="https://github.com/ms705/libfable"><code>libfable</code></a> repository that hasn’t seen any updates in a couple of
years. This got me a bit excited, and I started reading up a bit more on NUMA
support in Linux. I came across a <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/486858/"><em>Linux Weekly News</em> article</a>
from 2012 on NUMA aware scheduling support. So many things to think about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the idea home NUMA nodes for processes</li>
  <li>moving physical pages between nodes while leaving virtual addresses intact</li>
  <li>grouping processes together into NUMA groups that will always share a home
node</li>
  <li>the performance gains possible by understanding and exploiting hardware
details</li>
</ul>

<p>On the performance note, a quote from the LWN article stands out:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Without the NUMA balancing patches, over time, the benchmark ended up with
just as many remote memory accesses as local accesses - allocated memory was
spread across the system. With the NUMA balancer, 86% of the memory accesses
were local, leading to a significant speedup.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NUMA: serious business.</p>

<p>After a while I was able to settle down again from all this IPC excitement and
think about how to approach the list-IP-addresses utility. I decided to go with
some <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html">README-driven development</a>, and drafted up a README. After a bit,
I changed the aim to writing a manpage. This was driven by a secret desire to
use <a href="http://asciidoc.org/">AsciiDoc</a> (see also: <a href="http://asciidoctor.org/">AsciiDoctor</a>), as I’ve been wanting to check it out as a Markdown alternative
for a while. I knew it had good support for manpage generation. In fact, the
<a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/"><code>git</code> docs</a> are in AsciiDoc.</p>

<p>So, current status:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I have some flags being parsed</li>
  <li>can list IPv4 addresses</li>
  <li>manpage needs some rewording and reworking</li>
  <li>the tool needs a name. I had <code>lsip</code>, after <code>lsof</code>, but it looks wrong. I’m
now thinking <code>lsaddr</code>. I am bad at names.</li>
</ul>
