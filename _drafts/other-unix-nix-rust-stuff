Things that suck:
  - error handling
  - flag types

I particularly mean Unix stuff where you're doing processes and files and blah blah.

In C you need to read the man page to know what the error return is, and then check errno. Nobody shouts at you if you don't.

Nix wraps these things in a very thin layer of Rustiness: the return value / errno dance is wrapped up in a Result. You also get warnings if you don't check them.

This means you can write programs against the system libraries with idiomatic error handling.

You also get typesafe flags, so if you're using `mount` in Linux you can't accidentally pass `MNT_FLAGS` in place of `MS_FLAGS`.

Optional arguments are also flagged as such using `Option`.

This makes systems programming available to people who don't have a background in C and reading man pages.

You use C. You get to know your man pages, especially the `RETURN VALUE` and `ERRORS` sections. You use `goto` to clean up in case of errors.
