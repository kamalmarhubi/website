Tomorrow is my first day at the [Recurse Center](!!). I just reread the
[manual][rc-manual], and it made me think a bit about what I'm comfortable
with, what I'm not, and how I'm hoping to use my time at RC.

[rc-manual]: https://www.recurse.com/manual "The Recurse Center User's Manual"
[Recurse Centre]: https://www.recurse.com/ "The Recurse Center"

The manual lists the [traits of an awesome Recurser][recurser-traits]:

- be rigorous
- strive for greatness
- reflect on your progress

I feel fairly set with the first two. I'm rigorous almost to a fault, and
strive for at least some definition of greatness.This blog post is start on my
reflection on progress, and I'll keep posting here as the summer progresses. I
want to force myself to put more time into writing down what I'm learning than
I think is reasonable; we'll see how that turns out!

From the rest of the user's manual, I came up with a list of relevant things
make me feel (un)comfortable.

Comfortable:

 - getting and giving code review, particularly in Python or C++
 - writing code slowly
 - agonizing over details[^details] and being idiomatic in whatever tool or
   language (this leads directly to the above)


Uncomfortable:

 - pair programming (there is a [huge section][rc-pairing] on pairing in the manual)
 - writing code quickly
 - writing unidiomatic code that works now
 - pair programming
 - also, pair programming

The ‘uncomfortable’ list is particularly telling, and points to where I should
focus on the not-entirely-technical side of things. I'll definitely be
reflecting on progress there throughout the summer, along with many other
areas.

And now to sleep!

[^details]:
    eg, I spent a non-zero amount of time thinking about: whether to spell it
    ‘Center’ or ‘Centre’; how many times to include pair programming in the
    ‘uncomfortable list’; and what symbol set to use for footnotes: numbers or  *,
    †, ‡, §, …—I eventually settled on using the built-in [footnote
    feature][kramdown-footnotes] of the [kramdown] Markdown processor used by
    Jekyll
