title: A touch of Plain Bob Minor

I'm almost as excited about getting to [ring][ringing] all summer in NYC as I
am about being at the Recurse Center. This evening I went to [Trinity Wall
Street][trinity], met some old friends, and rang some bells. I think the last
time I got to ring tower bells was in Toronto last June, which is a little bit
longer than usual.

There was a relatively low turnoutâ€”I think we were just twelve in all,
including a visitor from England. The band was really accommodating of me. I
started off tenoring behind to some plain courses of [Grandsire] triples.
There was lots of overpulling as usual, but [ropesight] was intact: I was able
to see the dodging at the back. Later in the evening, I tenored behind a touch,
and I could also see the double dodging when a single was called, which was fun
to notice.

After the Grandsire, I rang inside for a plain course of [Plain Bob
Minor][pb6]. I told the ringers I'd rung a quarter peal of minor inside, but
that I think I was mistaken. The imagined quarter didn't show up in a search on
[Campanophile]. I vaguely remember that it was in fact a failed attempt in
Toronto. In any case, the plain course went pretty smoothly

And close to the end of the practice, I got to ring a touch! The touch had my
bell skip all the dodging, but I got to make a single which was new for me in
tower. I actually found this slightly easier than the plain course: thanks to
handbells I don't have too much trouble figuring out what to do at a call, and
there's something about down-dodges that I'm not happy about in tower.

All in all, a really excellent first time ringing. Starting off this well, I'm
really excited about making some proper progress this summer!
