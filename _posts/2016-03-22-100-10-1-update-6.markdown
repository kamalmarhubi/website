I said [last time][last] that I should keep a log; I didn't. This is from
memory + what I could convince git and GitHub to tell me. Writing this also
makes me realize that now we're two months into 100:10:1, I should promote some
more projects to round out my list of 10. I'll try and make some progress there
this week!

## projects I worked on this week

### containy-thing

I made some really minor changes to [containy-thing], which I haven't pushed up
to GitHub yet. I switched to using the released version of [nix] to pick up a
couple of changes I'd made to [enable `mount(2)`][mount], and [make safe
wrappers for `getuid(2)` and `getgid(2)`][getuid].

This is kind of cool because it's popping some yaks off [the yak
stack][yak-stack]: I initially got involved with nix to make those changes.
Somehow I wound up making [lots more][nix-issues] [contributions][nix-commits],
and becoming a maintainer. It's a fun circle, because I'm coming back to
containy-thing in order to get the CI for nix to run faster.

### silly key-value store

I did some initial work on this still-mysterious project. I'm pretty excited
for finally starting on it! Watch this space. :-)
