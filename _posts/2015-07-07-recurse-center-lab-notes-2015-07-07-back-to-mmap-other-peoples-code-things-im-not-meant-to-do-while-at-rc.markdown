I went back to `mmap` today. I am finally attempting to put together what I
picked up from experimenting in the last while towards writing a memory mapped
file message builder for Cap'n Proto. Current status:

- I've created a new class with a constructor `MmapMessageBuilder(int
  fd)` that maps the file descriptor
- Things mostly magically work because I'm supplying an alternate
  implementation of an interface
- I am not yet handling the resizing of the backing file in any way
- I am not yet including a segment table at the front of the file

The last one means I can't get the files read back in with the existing
deserializers. I was totally able to see it in the bytes though!

Writing out the segment table mostly requires trawling through someone else's
code base. The Cap'n Proto code is fairly clear and well documented, especially
the user interfaces. Some key innards are not as well documented, however. In
particular, the [arena abstraction][capnp-arena] used to look after the
allocated segments could do with a short overview. I'm most of the way to
understanding how it fits together, but it's been slower than I would have
liked.

[capnp-arenal]: https://github.com/sandstorm-io/capnproto/blob/1702050903e1038acf0556c6eabcf8f99702690d/c%2B%2B/src/capnp/arena.h#L197

The process of understanding the code has been slowed by needing to learn the
[`kj`][kj] library that Cap'n Proto makes heavy use of. I'm trying to find out
the boundaries of what `kj` aims to be, but so far it looks to include:

- replacements for some standard library classes, eg, [`kj::Own`][kj-own]
  is used where you might use[ `std::unique_ptr`][std-unique_ptr], and
  there is a separate [stream abstraction][kj-io] that is used instead of
  [the standard one][std-io]
- an event loopâ€”the C++ standard library still has nothing here; it may
  in 2017 though!
- some templated array classes that seem to be a pointer-length pair;
  there is some macro magic to allow allocating such an array on the
  stack

[kj]: https://github.com/sandstorm-io/capnproto/tree/master/c%2B%2B/src/kj
[kj-own]: https://github.com/sandstorm-io/capnproto/blob/1702050903e1038acf0556c6eabcf8f99702690d/c%2B%2B/src/kj/memory.h#L99
[kj-io]: https://github.com/sandstorm-io/capnproto/blob/master/c%2B%2B/src/kj/io.h

[std-unique_ptr]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr
[std-io]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io

An overview of this library would also be really nice to have. My life
would be a bit easier if this was all STL stuff.

All this frustration has me trying to use Google's [Kythe code indexing
project][kythe] on Cap'n Proto. This in turn has me messing around with their
[Bazel build tool][bazel].  Both of these tools are up there on my
not-while-at-RC list, but I'm giving myself a very short pass to see if I can
port the build over.  Building these tools is pretty slow going...
