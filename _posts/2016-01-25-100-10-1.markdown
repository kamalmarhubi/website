Last week I decided to join [Nat] and [Steve] and make an attempt at the
100:10:1 project idea generation / implementation idea [Nick
Bentley][nick-bentley-blog] wrote about in the context of game design, and
[fogus adapted to open source projects][fogus-blog]. It's a three step process:

1. come up with 100 project ideas
3. build MVPs for 10 of them
4. develop 1 of them into a complete thing

I'm playing catch up with Nat and Steve, who both have their 100 and 10 already
picked out! But I've got my 100 ideas together now, which are listed at the end
of this post without any organization.

Some takeaways from doing this:

* I'm *really* interested in lower level / infrastructure / systems stuff at
  the moment
* I really like Rust
* I really like Kubernetes
* and some other things
* not much in the way of producty or goofy ideas as compared to the other two, but there you go!

# 100

* heroku clone on kubernetes
* container thing for running commands in container context without privileges
* rust high perf networking http server (techempower benchmarks, haywire)
* rust async library experiments: curio, asyncio, folly, util::Task
* rust ideas around cancellation for async: util::Task, golang.org/x/net/context, C# CancellationToken
* rust lib to restart without dropping connections
* tuf + rust + crates
* kythe extractor / indexer for rust
* kythe (?) based github search that doesn't suck
* kythe browser that works nice
* package pageshot for sandstorm
* static site generator using service worker / amp / ... ?
* graphiql / graphql for jsonapi
* "cloud" load balancer for kubernetes
* criu + cap'n proto (?) for magic on-demand lb
* implement tcp/ip (in rust?)
* build reliable communication on top of udp
* cap'n proto shared memory transport
* cap'n proto mmap message builder
* figure out userfaultfd for the above
* ebpf based strace
* seccomp (bpf) for rust
* multiprocess lib for rust
* pledge clone for linux using seccomp-bpf + namespaces
* extend roaring bitmap rust to handle runs
* rust clap bash completions
* x_things twitter bot generator -- creates bot, heroku app, sends credentials
* window tiny lfu (w-tinylfu) cache gh/ben-manes/caffeine/wiki/efficiency
* cap'n proto compiler bootstrapping with json
* debugger (500 lines)
* test tool at syscall interface (ptrace / seccomp bpf?)
* explore allowing overlayfs with namespace owned mounts
* kubernetes + timely dataflow
* rustfmt line range & diff reading (format a patch)
* rustdoc improvements: stable since, target differences
* package firefox sync for sandstorm
* fuzz cap'n proto rust
* AFL + quickcheck: coverage directed fuzzing for rust / testing
* markdown editor with gdoc like commenting and suggesting
* port rustc build to bazel
* port cap'n proto build to bazel
* port sandstorm build to bazel
* web-based handbell ringing app
* bazel docker improvements
* bazel appc rules
* kubernetes appc support
* bazel rust rules support cross compilation
* csmith for rust (generate random programs)
* blue line cenerator / viewer for web
* composition checker
* ringing social app (a la ravelry?) with peal & qp reports
* octopus holdings zulip bot
* two corpus twitter bot generator (a la erowidrecruiter)
* rust crate version vs rust language version
* hybrid logical clock implementation (rust?)
* impelemnt a crdt
* implement a consensus protocol
* create an official backport for debian -- nodejs?

* something like scapy for network playing around but in rust
* rust take on jgc's little parallel do stuff library
* memcached speaking thing
* redis speaking thing
* spliterator for rust (if it makes sense)
* gitsync w/ray
* ssh multiplexer / proxy thing (?)
* custom replacement of the screen-on app thing on android with timeouts built in
* hyper log log on timely dataflow
* command line client for banq
* command line client for tangerine
* token bucket in rust
* rethinkdb client in rust
* rust config library using command line flags, env vars, config files (w/overriding)

* fd transfer for cap'n proto
* trusted build service (toto)
* rust libc generator or test constants (& signatures?)
* sites & mobile app that lets my family track our locations
* something like the original hangouts -- say you're vailable to hangout (again, family)
* tool to blas through images and highlight some picks as video
* god bold rustc asm output thing (historical)
* grpc for rust
