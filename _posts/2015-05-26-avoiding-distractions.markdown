title: Avoiding distractions

This morning, as part of the Recurse Center's welcome talks, [Mary Rose
Cook][mary] gave some advice on how to spend twelve weeks of unstrucutred time.
You can see similar advice in the Recurse Center  manual's [advice
section][rc-advice], where they are divided up by level of experience:
relatively new to programming; already have good grasp of one language; and
really experienced.

There is one item that appears on all three lists: ‚Äòavoid distractions‚Äô.

Aside from a delightful pairing experience[^ann-pairing] with [Ann], my only
technical work today was on the one thing I had decided not to work
on[^non-project] at the Recurse Center. While today was the first day, and it started
later and ended earlier than most days will, I'll still need to keep a close watch.

[^ann-pairing]:
    I learned some Ruby syntax and we refactored a
    guess-the-number-from-0-to-99 game. The absolute best part was where we wanted
    to test something about the iteration, but won with 50 on the first try. The
    program very accurately told us that we were ‚Äòthe best at this!‚Äô

    On the bright side, I finally got my 3-node [etcd] cluster running etcd2,
    which was blocking further progress on that project.
